# Full-Stack Review and Improvement Roadmap

## Scope

This document captures:

- Current project review findings (frontend + backend)
- Improvements implemented in this iteration
- Recommended architecture, performance, testing, and deployment plan

## Current State Review

### Strengths

- Clear split between `client` and `server` projects.
- Backend domain is reasonably separated by controllers, routes, and models.
- Frontend uses typed React with dedicated `api/` modules.
- Core entities are already modeled in MongoDB with references.

### Key Risks (Before Changes)

- Inconsistent frontend networking (`axios` + `fetch` + direct absolute URLs), causing drift and auth issues.
- JWT fallback secrets were present in multiple server controllers.
- Several CRUD routes had no authorization checks.
- Input validation was minimal in auth and user-related flows.
- N+1 query patterns in customer/employee listing endpoints.
- Server had no centralized 404/error response behavior.

## Implemented Improvements

### Backend hardening

- Enforced explicit Bearer token parsing and JWT secret presence in auth middleware.
- Removed insecure JWT fallback defaults from auth/customer/employee token generation paths.
- Added request body size limits and URL-encoded parser.
- Added environment-driven CORS handling via `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- Added centralized 404 and global error middleware.

### Backend authorization

- Protected sensitive routes with `auth` + `adminOnly`:
  - customers list/register/update
  - employees list/add/update/delete
  - orders CRUD
  - services CRUD
  - inventories CRUD
  - vehicles CRUD

### Backend data and reliability

- Added basic request validation in auth/customer/employee/inventory create flows.
- Optimized N+1 data access patterns:
  - `getAllCustomers` now batch-fetches `CustomerInfo` and maps by id.
  - `getAllEmployees` now batch-fetches `EmployeeInfo`, `EmployeeRole`, and roles.
- Standardized inventory delete response to include deleted item and proper 404 handling.

### Frontend integration improvements

- Standardized all API modules to use the shared client in `src/utils/axios.ts`.
- Shared client now uses env base URL fallback and default timeout.
- Login UI now uses unified auth API helper instead of manual endpoint branching calls.
- Service APIs migrated from `fetch` to shared axios instance.
- Inventory API now handles wrapped backend responses safely.

### Dashboard architecture improvements

- Added dedicated summary endpoint for admin insights: `GET /api/orders/dashboard/summary`.
- Dashboard summary now returns:
  - totals (orders, pending, employees, customers, services, low stock)
  - status breakdown (Received, In Progress, Completed, Canceled)
  - revenue aggregate
  - recent activity feed
- Frontend overview now consumes summary endpoint with graceful fallback to existing list-based state.
- Reduced dashboard coupling to full order payload fetches for KPI cards.

## Architecture Recommendations (Next Iteration)

### 1) Backend modularization

- Introduce service layer (`services/`) between controllers and models.
- Add request validators (`zod` or `joi`) per route group.
- Introduce shared response helpers and domain error classes.

### 2) API contract consistency

- Standardize response envelope:
  - success: `{ data, meta? }`
  - error: `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`
- Version APIs with `/api/v1` for forward compatibility.

### 3) Security improvements

- Add `helmet` and strict CORS by environment.
- Add auth rate limiting on login/register endpoints.
- Rotate JWT secret and enforce secret presence on startup.
- Consider refresh tokens with short-lived access tokens.

### 4) Performance and scalability

- Add compound indexes for heavy query paths (orders by status/date, lookups by foreign ids).
- Add pagination/filter/sort for listing endpoints (orders, employees, customers, inventory).
- Use `lean()` where mutation is not required.
- Add Redis cache for high-read endpoints if traffic increases.

### 5) Deployment strategy

- Containerize server and client with multi-stage Docker builds.
- Use separate env files per stage (dev/staging/prod).
- Add reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) and HTTPS termination.
- Add CI pipeline: lint, build, tests, security scan.

## Testing and Debugging Plan

### Immediate test targets

- Auth login/register happy + invalid credentials + missing token.
- Route authorization matrix for admin/non-admin users.
- Controller validation failures (400) and not-found cases (404).
- API integration tests for orders and inventory CRUD.

### Suggested stack

- Backend: `vitest` or `jest` + `supertest` + Mongo memory server.
- Frontend: `vitest` + React Testing Library.
- E2E: Playwright for login/dashboard/order workflows.

### Coverage goals

- Minimum 70% line coverage for backend controllers and middleware first.
- Raise to 80% after adding service layer.

## Documentation To Add Next

- API reference (endpoint, request, response, auth requirements).
- Environment setup guide with required variables and examples.
- Local development workflow and seed data instructions.
- Incident/debug runbook for common failures.

## Required Environment Variables

- `MONGODB_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional)

## Change Management Notes

- Because admin authorization was added to many CRUD routes, ensure admin login is used before accessing dashboard data.
- Ensure application `.env` contains Better Auth variables for local/dev domains.
